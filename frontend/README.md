# 🍽️ Hunger Connect

**Hunger Connect** is a web platform inspired by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal: **Zero Hunger**. It bridges the gap between food **donors** and **NGOs (distributors)** to minimize food wastage and ensure excess food reaches those in need.

Built using **React**, **Firebase**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**, and deployed with **Vercel**, the app offers real-time updates and seamless interaction between users.
